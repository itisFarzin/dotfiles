### Personal Dotfiles

A collection of my personal dotfiles for my Linux setup for Hyprland.

Originally based on [typecraft-dev's dotfiles](https://github.com/typecraft-dev/dotfiles) with changes.
Waybar configurations are adapted from [m4xshen's dotfiles](https://github.com/m4xshen/dotfiles) with some modifications.

- Terminal: kitty
- File Manager: thunar
- App Launcher: rofi
- Wallpaper Manager: wpaperd
- Clipboard Manager: cliphist

Notes:
- I hardcoded my monitor specs in `hyprland.conf` and waybar's `config.jsonc` to ensure correct output and prevent waybar's crash after suspend
- rofi configs is based on (adi1090x's rofi collection)[https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi] with small modifications

Feel free to explore and use any parts that interest you!
